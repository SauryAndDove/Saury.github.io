              <h3 class="eventTitle">International Children’s Day Event</h3>
            </div>
            <p>On June 1, 2025, International Children’s Day, our team collaborated with the Trade Union of BUCT (Beijing University of Chemical Technology) to hold a celebration for children.</p>
            <p>Since this year’s Dragon Boat Festival is close to Children’s Day, we included a paper-folding activity to make Zongzi, allowing the children to experience the charm of traditional Chinese culture while gradually transforming into a mindset ready to absorb biological knowledge.</p>
            <p>In this activity, we guided the children in painting marine animals, aiming to cultivate an awareness of protecting the ocean and caring for marine life. In parallel, our team members customized a set of cards that is written in the vocabulary of synthetic biology, and each card is displayed in Chinese, English, and French. Our team members explained the meanings of the words in Chinese firstly and then led the children to learn their English and French. Even though the vocabulary learning session was short, we still sincerely hoped that the children could gain a basic understanding of synthetic biology and our programs could root an eco-friendly consciousness in their hearts.</p>

              <h3 class="eventTitle">Watching a film about ocean plastic pollution</h3>
            </div>
            <h4 class="subLabel">Description & Implementation</h4>
            <p>In June 2025, we co-hosted a film screening on marine plastic pollution in collaboration with the BUCT Foreign Language Association. Following the screening, we encouraged all participants to join an interactive discussion. Students shared their perspectives on the main sources of marine plastic pollution, including single-use plastics and microplastics. Also, we explored the environmental and societal consequences, including harm to marine life and threats to human health. The discussion also covered possible solutions, ranging from governmental policies to technological innovations, like recycling and reducing personal plastic use.</p>
            <p>By connecting the content of the film to real-world issues and personal actions, we hope that this dialogue transformed passive viewing into active learning, fostering critical thinking, problem-solving, and a sense of personal responsibility toward caring for nature.</p>
            <h4 class="subLabel reflectionLabel">Reflection</h4>
            <p class="reflectionText">This film screening provided an engaging and vivid platform to raise public awareness of marine plastic pollution. By showcasing the severity of ocean plastic pollution, it helped students gain a deeper understanding of the environmental crisis. Our collaboration with the BUCT Foreign Language Association facilitated cross-cultural communication, enabling students from diverse backgrounds to appreciate international perspectives. Through discussion and reflection, the activity fostered a sense of environmental responsibility and encouraged collective efforts to protect the oceans and the natural environment.</p>

              <h3 class="eventTitle">Lecture on Plastic Governance Policies</h3>
            </div>
            <p>We arranged a lecture on plastic governance policies to draw attention to the seriousness of plastic pollution and the attention that this issue has received worldwide. The objective was to help participants comprehend the fundamentals of global plastic governance by fusing scientific innovation, public awareness, and policy context.</p>
            <p>One participant in the lecture posed a very good question: given commonplace items like plastic straws or takeout containers, from manufacture to disposal, which phase of their lifecycle is most likely to result in pollution, and where can people most effectively intervene?</p>
            <p>In response, we explained that every stage of a plastic’s lifecycle has environmental impacts, but controlling the source is especially critical. For example, synthetic biology approaches can be applied to modify plastics, enabling them to degrade efficiently in natural environments and thereby reducing future pollution risks from the production stage itself. On top of this, individual actions also play a crucial role. Participants were encouraged to reduce single-use plastics, choose recyclable or biodegradable alternatives, and participate in local recycling programs, making tangible contributions to pollution mitigation in their daily lives.</p>
            <p>The lecture's goal was to encourage participants to join the group effort in environmental protection and plastic pollution governance by encouraging them to think about systemic and personal interventions through a mix of interactive discussion and knowledge sharing.</p>

              <h3 class="eventTitle">Artistic Engagement online</h3>
            </div>
            <h4 class="subLabel">Description & Implementation</h4>
            <p>Beyond the engaging storytelling of our theatrical performances, we sought to create more diverse opportunities to integrate art with environmental protection. To achieve this, our team organized an aesthetics-focused competition centered on biology, ocean conservation, and plastic pollution. Students were invited to express their understanding of these themes through creative formats such as painting, short videos, and DIY projects, using art as a medium to share their ideas and inspire others to reflect on environmental issues.</p>
            <h4 class="subLabel reflectionLabel">Reflection</h4>
            <div class="reflectionBox">
                <p>We were delighted to receive feedback and submissions from participating students. Through their unique interpretations of art and their understanding of the ocean and biology, they demonstrated a strong sense of environmental awareness and a desire to use their creative works to inspire more people to take action in protecting the ocean.</p>
                <p>Although the feedback was positive, we also recognized some shortcomings. The reach of this activity was not as broad as we had hoped, and the number of participants was limited. To improve future educational events and encourage greater participation, our team analyzed the reasons behind this outcome. First, our promotion relied solely on a single WeChat post, without more extensive offline efforts such as posters or on-campus presentations. This limited publicity was the primary reason for the low participation rate. Second, the event was held during the summer vacation, when many students focus on travel, personal development, or other activities, leaving them less likely to engage. Moving forward, we believe that scheduling such activities in the middle of the academic term would be more effective.</p>
